# ------------------------------------------------------- R6 meter fraud
# energy_residual_kwh = reported register - integral(reported power dt).
# An honest session holds this on its N(0, 0.05) baseline (CONTEXT.md FIX-9).
# A station under-reporting power while its register accrues the truth makes it
# climb, which is the direct signature of billing fraud.
#
# The rule reads the *current* rate of climb, not the session mean. A mean over
# duration_sec is diluted by however long the station behaved honestly first:
# observed live, CP-03 charged cleanly for ~70 s and then spoofed for ~40 s,
# giving 1.60 kWh over 110.7 s = 0.0145 kWh/s -- under threshold, so the attack
# went undetected. The longer a station behaves before it turns, the more
# invisible the fraud becomes, which is backwards.
#
# Rate also separates the two under-reporting attacks, which an absolute level
# cannot. meter_spoof reports a flat 5 kW against a real ~120 kW, a constant
# 0.032 kWh/s. subtle_drift compounds -2%/tick, so its rate ramps and does not
# reach 0.025 kWh/s until ~69 s -- well after its ML score crosses 0.65 at
# ~40 s, which keeps the "ML only" demo beat intact.
