# CONTEXT.md — VoltSentry System Specification (v2, hardened)

> **v2 changelog:** fixes 11 contract gaps found in v1 review. Every change is marked `[FIX-n]`.
> This file is the **binding spec**. The plan argues from it. If plan and spec disagree, spec wins.

## 1. Hackathon Core Strategy: Cost & Time Efficiency

VoltSentry is engineered for a **48-hour hackathon build (CodeToCreate, VIT Vellore)**. Every
architectural decision optimizes for **zero financial cost** and **maximum speed to a working demo**.

### Cost Efficiency ($0 Total Spend)
* **Software-Defined Cyber-Physical Twin:** replaces $10,000+ of physical chargers, relays and power
  meters with a discrete-time Python physics loop on `localhost`.
* **Zero paid API dependencies:** local `scikit-learn` instead of cloud anomaly services;
  pre-rendered static `.mp3` clips instead of live TTS calls; JSON-lines files and in-memory state
  instead of a hosted database.
* **100% localhost execution:** no cloud infrastructure.

### Time Efficiency (48-hour execution)
* **Contract-first schema lock:** `shared/schemas.py` and the wire envelope in §6 are **frozen at
  Hour 1**. Three developers build against the contract in parallel, never against each other's
  running code.
* **Dual-tier pragmatism:** Tier-1 deterministic rules cover the loud attacks at zero latency.
  Tier-2 `IsolationForest` fits in <0.2 s at proxy boot — no labelling, no training loop.
* **Fake-data-first frontend:** the dashboard is built against a recorded fixture file
  (`dashboard/fixtures/replay.jsonl`) from Hour 1, so Person 3 is never blocked on the proxy.
  `[FIX-1]`
* **Deterministic demo loop:** the Red-Team CLI drives every attack on a keypress. No live sensors,
  no flaky hardware, no timing races in front of judges.

## 2. What Is VoltSentry?

VoltSentry is a software-defined, inline cybersecurity reverse proxy and threat-detection platform
for EV fast-charging networks.

It is a transparent security guard sitting at the transport layer between charging stations
(OCPP clients) and the Central Management System (CSMS server). It intercepts every OCPP 1.6-J
WebSocket frame in real time, validates the payload, enforces session state transitions, and runs a
dual-tier detection engine (deterministic FSM + physics rules, plus an Isolation Forest behavioural
model) to detect and quarantine attacks before they reach the backend or destabilise the grid.

---

## 3. Domain Background

### The problem
Public EV charging runs on OCPP 1.6-J over WebSockets. Chargers are physically exposed, often on
weakly authenticated connections, making them soft cyber-physical edge nodes on critical energy
infrastructure.

* **Cloud CSMS platforms audit after the fact** — batch analysis minutes or hours after ingestion,
  long after an active attack has done its damage.
* **Hardware retrofits are economically dead** — you cannot ship a firewall chip to millions of
  deployed stations.
* **VoltSentry's approach:** pure software at the transport layer, sub-millisecond added latency,
  zero hardware modification, drop-in in front of an existing CSMS.

### Threat vectors mitigated
1. **Meter spoofing / billing fraud** — under-reporting delivered energy so a session bills near
   zero while real power flows.
2. **Coordinated grid oscillation** — synchronised rapid start/stop of high-power chargers across a
   cluster to induce load swings that trip a local distribution transformer.
3. **Session shadowing / hijacking** — parallel WebSocket handshakes reusing a live
   `chargePointId` to displace a legitimate charger or seize its session.
4. **Subtle zero-day data drift** — slow compounding falsification that stays inside every hard
   threshold band, invisible to rule engines.

---

## 4. Architecture

### 4.1 Process & port matrix `[FIX-2]`

| Process | Owner | Listens | Talks to |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Mock CSMS | P2 | `ws://localhost:9000/ocpp/{cpid}` | — |
| VoltSentry proxy — OCPP ingress | P1 | `ws://localhost:8000/ocpp/{cpid}` | CSMS `:9000` |
| VoltSentry proxy — dashboard fanout | P1 | `ws://localhost:8100/feed` | browser |
| Charger fleet twin | P2 | — (client) | proxy `:8000` |
| Twin control channel | P2 | `ws://localhost:9100/control` | — |
| NOC dashboard | P3 | `http://localhost:3000` | proxy `:8100` |

**`[FIX-2]` — dashboard transport.** v1 specified Socket.io on the frontend against a raw
`websockets` Python server. Those protocols are not compatible. The dashboard feed is now a **plain
WebSocket** on a **separate port (8100)**, consumed by the browser's native `WebSocket` API. No
Socket.io, no `python-socketio`, no path-routing bugs on 8000.

**`[FIX-3]` — station identity.** v1 never said how the proxy knows which station a socket belongs
to. Per OCPP 1.6-J the charge point ID lives in the **URL path**: a client connects to
`ws://localhost:8000/ocpp/CP-04`. The proxy parses `cpid` from the path at handshake, before any
frame arrives, and opens the matching upstream socket to `ws://localhost:9000/ocpp/CP-04`.

### 4.2 Data flow

```
twin (CP-01..CP-08) ──ws:8000──▶ PROXY ──ws:9000──▶ mock CSMS
                                   │
                        rules.py + ml_engine.py
                                   │
                                   ├── ws:8100 ──▶ Next.js dashboard
                                   └── logs/incidents.jsonl

attack.py ──ws:9100──▶ twin control channel  [FIX-4]
```

**`[FIX-4]` — the attack CLI cannot MITM a socket it does not own.** This was v1's most serious
hole. `attack.py` is a separate process; it has no access to the twin↔proxy socket to "rewrite
outgoing meter values." Corrected design: **`attack.py` is a remote control for the twin.** It sends
an `AttackTrigger` over the twin's control channel (`:9100`); the twin flips the named station into
a compromised behaviour mode and starts emitting malicious frames itself. The proxy sees genuinely
hostile traffic on the wire. Same demo, ~3 hours cheaper, and architecturally honest.

`session_shadow` is the exception — it opens its own second socket directly to `:8000` with an
already-active `chargePointId`, which is exactly the real attack.

---

## 5. Feature Set

### A. Inline transport proxy (`/proxy`)
* **Transparent reverse proxy** — accepts on `:8000`, forwards clean traffic to `:9000` unmodified.
  Bidirectional relay: CSMS→charger frames pass through untouched.
* **OCPP 1.6-J frame handling `[FIX-5]`** — the wire format is a JSON **array**, not an object:
  * `CALL`: `[2, "<uniqueId>", "<Action>", {payload}]`
  * `CALLRESULT`: `[3, "<uniqueId>", {payload}]`
  * `CALLERROR`: `[4, "<uniqueId>", "<code>", "<desc>", {details}]`
  A `CALLRESULT` **does not carry the action name**. The proxy keeps a
  `pending: dict[uniqueId -> action]` map per connection so it can correlate
  `StartTransaction` → its returned `transactionId`. Without this map the session FSM cannot work.
* **Active quarantine `[FIX-6]`** — on a Tier-1 block the proxy (a) drops the offending frame,
  (b) sends `[2, "<uuid>", "ChangeAvailability", {"connectorId": 1, "type": "Inoperative"}]` **to the
  charger** (ChangeAvailability is a CSMS→CP call, so the proxy speaks it downstream), (c) waits for
  the twin's `CALLRESULT`, (d) closes the socket with code `4001`. The twin **must** handle inbound
  CALLs and reply — v1 never specified this and the quarantine would have hung.
* **Un-quarantine `[FIX-7]`** — the demo fires four attacks back to back. A severed station has no
  target for attack #2. `attack.py reset` clears proxy quarantine state and tells the twin to
  reconnect all stations to clean mode. Non-negotiable for the live demo.
* **Forensic logging** — one JSON object per line to `logs/incidents.jsonl`.

### B. Dual-tier detection engine

**Tier-1 — deterministic rules (`proxy/rules.py`)**

| Rule | Check | Trip condition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `R1_STATE_ORDER` | FSM per `cpid` | `MeterValues`/`StopTransaction` with no live `Authorize`→`StartTransaction` |
| `R2_PHYSICS` | CC-CV envelope | `power_kw > 150.0`, or `power_kw > 60.0` while `soc > 80.0` (CV taper), or `power_kw < 0` |
| `R3_OSCILLATION` | sliding window | ≥ **6** Start/Stop transitions fleet-wide in a **10 s** window `[FIX-8]` |
| `R4_SESSION_UNIQUE` | connection registry | second handshake for a `cpid` with a live session |
| `R5_TXN_INTEGRITY` | txn map | `MeterValues.transactionId` unknown or belongs to another `cpid` |

`[FIX-8]` — v1's `>0.5 Hz` was untestable: a frequency needs a window, and "fleet-wide" contradicted
a per-station attack. Restated as a countable predicate over a named window so it can be unit-tested
with a fake clock.

**Tier-2 — behavioural ML (`proxy/ml_engine.py`)**

* **Model:** `IsolationForest(n_estimators=100, contamination=0.02, random_state=42)`.
* **Feature vector (5-dim) `[FIX-9]`:**
  `[power_kw, soc, dp_dt, duration_sec, energy_residual_kwh]`
* **`[FIX-9]` — v1's 4-feature vector could not detect `subtle_drift`, its own headline attack.**
  A slow drift that stays inside the normal band is by construction *not* a point outlier; the model
  would have stayed silent in front of the judges. Fixed by adding a session-cumulative feature the
  proxy can compute from the wire alone:
  `energy_residual_kwh = reported_Energy.Active.Import.Register_kWh − ∫ reported_power_kw dt`
  Honest sessions hold this near zero (baseline: `N(0, 0.05)`). Any drift between the reported
  instantaneous power and the accumulating energy register makes it climb monotonically, and the
  forest fires. This is the single highest-risk fix in v2.
* **`dp_dt` cold start `[FIX-10]`** — undefined on the first `MeterValues` of a session. Contract:
  `dp_dt = 0.0` for sample 1, and **samples 1–2 of a session are not scored** (`ml_score = 0.0`).
  Without this every session start throws a false positive on camera.
* **Score normalisation `[FIX-11]`** — `decision_function` returns *higher = more normal* on an
  unbounded raw scale, so "0.65" was meaningless across processes. Pinned at fit time:

  ```
  d      = clf.decision_function(X_train)
  d_max  = d.max()
  d_min  = percentile(d, 0.5)
  score(x) = clip((d_max - clf.decision_function(x)) / (d_max - d_min), 0.0, 1.0)
  ```
  Deterministic given `random_state=42`. **Alert threshold: `ml_score > 0.65`.**

### C. Cyber-physical twin (`/simulator`)
* **CC-CV battery engine** — discrete-time loop, 1 Hz tick: constant-current to 80% SoC, then
  exponential taper to 100%. Tracks pack voltage, current, SoC, cumulative kWh.
* **Fleet** — 8 stations `CP-01`..`CP-08` by default, staggered session starts.
* **Compromise modes** — each station holds a `mode` flag driven by the control channel:
  `clean | meter_spoof | oscillate | drift`.
* **Inbound CALL handling `[FIX-6]`** — the twin answers `ChangeAvailability` and `Reset` with a
  `CALLRESULT` and applies the state change.
* **Transformer monitor** — shared 500 kVA transformer; tracks aggregate load and headroom, emitted
  on the dashboard feed as its own event `[FIX-12]` (v1 computed it in the twin where the dashboard
  could never see it).

### D. Red-Team CLI (`/cli/attack.py`)
Single-keypress exploits over the twin control channel:

| Key | Attack | Effect | Expected detection |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `1` | `meter_spoof` | station reports 5 kW while drawing 120 kW | R2 + ML |
| `2` | `fleet_oscillate` | 1 Hz Start/Stop across all stations | R3 |
| `3` | `session_shadow` | duplicate handshake on a live `cpid` | R4 |
| `4` | `subtle_drift` | −2% compounding power under-report per tick | ML only (score climbs past 0.65 in ~40 s) |
| `r` | `reset` | clear quarantine, all stations back to clean | — |

### E. NOC dashboard (`/dashboard`)
* Next.js 14 (app router), Tailwind, Recharts, **native `WebSocket`** — no Socket.io.
* Station status grid, live power chart, SoC bars, transformer load gauge.
* Threat badges: 🔴 `RULE VIOLATION` (Tier-1, with `rule_id`), 🟡 `ML ANOMALY 0.84` (Tier-2).
* Pre-rendered `.mp3` alert on the first high-severity event (rate-limited to one per 10 s, and
  gated behind a user click so browser autoplay policy doesn't silently block it during the demo).
* **Reconnect with backoff** — the socket *will* drop when a laptop sleeps or the proxy restarts.
  Auto-reconnect every 2 s. `[FIX-13]`
* One-click JSON export of the captured event log.

### 6.2 OCPP payload shapes the proxy must parse `[FIX-14]`

v1 never pinned the `MeterValues` shape, which is deeply nested and the #1 place two developers
silently disagree. Frozen:

```json
[2, "a3f1", "MeterValues", {
  "connectorId": 1,
  "transactionId": 1041,
  "meterValue": [{
    "timestamp": "2026-09-06T15:04:05Z",
    "sampledValue": [
      {"value": "120.4", "measurand": "Power.Active.Import",         "unit": "kW"},
      {"value": "18.72", "measurand": "Energy.Active.Import.Register","unit": "kWh"},
      {"value": "64.0",  "measurand": "SoC",                          "unit": "Percent"}
    ]
  }]
}]
```

Extraction contract: `power_kw` from `measurand == "Power.Active.Import"` **in kW**,
`energy_register_kwh` from `Energy.Active.Import.Register` **in kWh**, `soc` from `SoC`.
Values are **strings** on the wire (OCPP requirement) and cast float-side by the proxy.
Timestamps on the OCPP wire are ISO-8601 `Z` strings; the `ts` float in §6.1 is the **proxy's**
receive clock, not the charger's claim. `[FIX-15]`

## 8. Run Order

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# T1
python -m simulator.csms          # :9000
# T2
python -m proxy.main              # :8000 ingress, :8100 feed
# T3
python -m simulator.twin          # fleet -> :8000, control :9100
# T4
python -m cli.attack              # TUI
# T5
cd dashboard && npm run dev       # :3000
```

Start order matters: CSMS → proxy → twin. The proxy dials upstream at handshake; if the CSMS is
down, every charger connection fails at accept.

## 9. Demo Script (4 minutes, rehearsed)

| t | Action | What the judge sees |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0:00 | dashboard on screen, fleet charging | 8 green stations, CC-CV curves rising, transformer at ~62% |
| 0:30 | one line on why OCPP is exposed | — |
| 1:00 | press `1` — meter_spoof | CP-03 goes red, `R2_PHYSICS`, frame dropped, station quarantined, audio alert |
| 1:40 | press `r`, then `2` — oscillate | transformer gauge swings, `R3_OSCILLATION` fires fleet-wide |
| 2:20 | press `r`, then `3` — session_shadow | shadow socket rejected at handshake, `R4_SESSION_UNIQUE` |
| 3:00 | press `r`, then `4` — subtle_drift | **no rule fires**; ML score climbs 0.2 → 0.71 over ~40 s, yellow badge |
| 3:40 | export forensic log | JSON downloads |

The `subtle_drift` beat is the pitch. It is the one attack a rule engine cannot catch, and it is why
Tier-2 exists. Rehearse it twice before judging.
