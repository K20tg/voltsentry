# The rule is a *rate*, not an absolute level, because absolute level cannot
# separate the two under-reporting attacks. meter_spoof reports a flat 5 kW
# against a real ~120 kW, a constant 0.032 kWh/s. subtle_drift compounds
# -2%/tick, so any absolute threshold low enough to catch a spoof quickly also
# trips drift before its ML score crosses 0.65, and Tier-2 stops being
# demonstrable.
#
# It is the *current* rate, not the session mean. A mean over duration_sec is
# diluted by however long the station behaved honestly beforehand: live, CP-03
# ran clean for ~70 s then spoofed for ~40 s, giving 1.60 kWh over 110.7 s =
# 0.0145 kWh/s, under threshold, and the attack went undetected. Under a mean,
# the longer a station behaves before it turns, the better it hides.
#
# At 0.025 kWh/s a spoof (0.032) trips on its first samples, while drift's
# ramping rate does not reach the line until ~69 s -- comfortably after its ML
# badge at ~40 s.
